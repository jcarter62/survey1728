Brother {name},

Hope you are doing well.
As part of the Knights of Columbus Council,
we are required to send in an annual survey of member activity.
The supreme office uses the form # 1728 that contains several categories of activities as well as monitary donations.  I believe they use this information to report to many internal and external parties about the good works we do as an organization.

I prepared a form online that you can used to fill out your information, and then I can compile the results and submit them to supreme.  The form is located at the following link:
https://forms.gle/XYZ123ABC456

Please use your last name as your username, and {access_code} as your password to log in and complete the form.

Please complete the form by the end of the month so we can meet our submission deadline.

If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out to me directly.

Thank you for your time and dedication to our council and the Knights of Columbus.
Vivat Jesus,
James Carter
Financial Secretary
Knights of Columbus Council 14241
